working:
	pair down mapcreator scipt
		key parts to break out (for to do later)
			save, load, UI for menu, ui for editing the actual map
			new: ui for interacting with foundation model
				code of interacting with foundation model
		think through what this script should actually be like and which parts should be pared downa nd related and waht not
		add in AbilityBuilderObject, AbilityEditScrollListButton
			
		hardcode a save path for the nameall part at the top
		add saving back in later
		remove campaign stuff
		probably ineed toa dd in INfoEventArgs script
			or maybe this is a unity hookup
		refreshleveldict

	
Main parts
	unity scene
		basic map generator manual functions
		need to pair down to the basics
			too many depencies in the script
	foundation model hook up


Functionality Questions
	how to get this to actually load
		ie chatGPT produces the code but can I run a code snippet in my existing thing
			this seems more interesting
			would need to have the API hook up take the output, grab the code section and write to file
		or should I ask it to produce the actual dict and just load the dict
			this seems easier
			just feed output into a custom loader
		

2D map builder							
	from an image or a description produce the tiles needed for a map (or whatever)						
	can supplement with better tiles for the code and what not						
							
	need a scene						
		need simple UI					
		need to be able do display					
		would like the camera things and able to rotate					
		lighting					
		materials					
		text box to access the LLM					
			some sort of beginning prompt as well				
			connect first time, send the prompt in				
			get the response				
			treat teh response. if response doesn't work do something				
			if it does work do something				
			add the yes/no and the results to the training set				
			some sort of approval/disapproval for how it works				
			expand to image				
		be able to save and load maps					
							
		i think first thing would be to prototype in chat GPT or copilot if the LLM can even generate the thing					
			if it is then increse the thresholding				
							
		maybe see if this is being done somewhere else					
			other games/envs/etc hook up

	maybe use some existing code I've written
https://github.com/AurelianTactics/OpenTactics/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/MapCreator/MapCreator.cs
	runs scene and edits and display
https://github.com/AurelianTactics/OpenTactics/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/View%20Model%20Component/Tile.cs
	list of these is what actuall gets saved
https://github.com/AurelianTactics/OpenTactics/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/View%20Model%20Component/Board.cs
	dict of of tiles belongs to this object
		public Dictionary<Point, Tile> tiles = new Dictionary<Point, Tile>();
https://github.com/AurelianTactics/OpenTactics/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Model/LevelData.cs
https://github.com/AurelianTactics/OpenTactics/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Model/Point.cs

	create this type of object to save and load
		DONE THIS IS FEASIBLE start super simple
			give some examples
				saved examples
				Assets/Customs/Levels/Custom/custom_0.dat
				code example
			
					can be simplified to not use some of the fucntions and the WAMG creator
					or maybe keep both in idk see how it goes
			so level data more like the save object. which saves a board .tiles so maybe use that
		
			give some simplified classes
			give some example promtpt and output
			try experimenting with the prompts

understand more about chat GPT
	best way to give code prompts
