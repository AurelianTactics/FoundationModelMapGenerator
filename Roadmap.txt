Likely halted for now. Prototyping completed.

Possible Future Steps:
* Experiment with base prompt and follow up prompts
* Document, reserach, and troubleshoot successes, failures, and paths for prompt improvement
* Send images to build map based on
* Send error response back to foundation model to get response
* Basic functionality and polish: UI, controls, save, load, chat history, waiting message for model etc
* More detailed maps: terrain, spawn points, tile/board code type features, etc.
* Error handling of foundation model response and more forgiving if response is not exact format
* Work with other models
* Improved handling of follow up conversations
* Finetuning with examples
